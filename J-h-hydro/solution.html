        <h2>1. Water Conservation</h2>
        <p>
            Hydroponic systems are highly efficient in water use, often requiring 70–90% less water than conventional soil gardening. This is because the water in hydroponic systems is recirculated and reused, with minimal loss to evaporation or runoff. Some advanced systems, like aeroponics, can use up to 98% less water than traditional farming methods.
        </p>
 
    </section>

    <section class="benefits">
        <h2>2. Higher Yields and Faster Growth</h2>
        <p>
            Plants grown hydroponically generally produce greater yields and grow faster than those cultivated in soil. This is due to the precise control over nutrients, pH, and environmental factors, ensuring that plants receive optimal conditions for growth at all times. As a result, hydroponic crops can yield two to four times more than traditional field farming, and harvest cycles can be shorter.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section  class="featured">
        <h2>3. Space Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
            Hydroponic gardening allows for much higher plant density, as plants do not need to spread their roots in search of nutrients. This means more plants can be grown in a smaller area, making hydroponics ideal for urban environments or places with limited arable land. Vertical farming techniques can further maximize space usage        </p>
 
    </section>

    <section class="benefits">
        <h2>4. Year-Round Production</h2>
        <p>
            Because hydroponic systems are typically housed indoors or in greenhouses, growers can control temperature, light, and humidity. This enables year-round cultivation, independent of outdoor climate or seasonal changes, and protects crops from extreme weather events.

        </p>
    </section>
    <section  class="featured">
        <h2>5. Reduced Pest and Disease Pressure</h2>
        <p>
            Without soil, many soil-borne pests and diseases are eliminated. Indoor hydroponic gardens also have fewer issues with insects and fungi, reducing the need for pesticides and making it easier to produce organic, residue-free crops        </p>
 
    </section>

    <section class="benefits">
        <h2>6. Flexibility in Location</h2>
        <p>
            Hydroponic systems can be set up almost anywhere-rooftops, basements, warehouses, or even deserts-since they do not depend on fertile soil. This flexibility opens up food production in areas previously unsuitable for agriculture        </p>
    </section>

    <section  class="featured">
        <h2>7. Environmental Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            By using less water and fewer pesticides and fertilizers, hydroponics can reduce the environmental footprint of agriculture. The controlled application of nutrients also minimizes nutrient runoff, which can pollute waterways in traditional farming        </p>
 
    </section>

    <section class="benefits">
        <h2>8. Ease of Harvest and Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            Hydroponic gardens are often designed at waist height, making planting, maintenance, and harvesting easier, especially for people with limited mobility.
